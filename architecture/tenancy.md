# Multi-Tenancy

## Overview

The platform supports multiple tenants. A **tenant** is an isolated organizational unit that owns all resources (agents, MCP servers, workspaces, models, threads, chats, etc.). Resources are scoped to a tenant — they are not visible or accessible across tenant boundaries.

## Tenant Model

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `id` | string (UUID) | Unique tenant identifier |
| `name` | string | Display name |
| `created_at` | timestamp | Creation time |

## Resource Scoping

Every resource in the platform belongs to a tenant. The `tenant_id` is present on all resource tables and used in all queries as a mandatory filter.

| Service | Scoped Resources |
|---------|-----------------|
| Teams | Agents, MCP Servers, Workspace Configurations, Models, LLM Providers, Secret Providers, Secrets, Memory Buckets, Attachments |
| Threads | Threads, Messages, MessageRecipients |
| Chat | Chats (thin layer over Threads — tenant scoping comes from Threads) |
| Files | File metadata and object keys |
| Agent State | Agent state records |
| Runner | Workloads are labeled with `tenant_id` |
| Notifications | Room subscriptions are implicitly scoped (room names include tenant-scoped resource IDs) |

## Data Isolation

All services that use PostgreSQL include `tenant_id` as a column on every tenant-scoped table. Queries always filter by `tenant_id`. There is no cross-tenant data access path.

Object storage (S3) keys are prefixed with `tenant_id` to partition files by tenant.

## Identity and Tenant Association

Every authenticated identity (user, agent, channel, runner) is associated with exactly one tenant. The tenant is resolved during authentication and propagated in request context to all downstream services. See [Authentication](authn.md) for identity types and authentication flows.
